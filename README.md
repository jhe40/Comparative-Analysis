# Comparative-Analysis
We crawled data from Twitter, which includes the context of the replies. We performed sentiment analysis to see what are people's reactions to the tweets about the campaigns. We used NLTK package to determine if a tweet has strong positive, positive, neutral, negative or strong neutral sentiment. First, the group had a list for positive words and a list of negative words. Then, the group assigned values to the positive, neutral and negative words. NLTK would detect how many positive and negative words there were in each tweet and calculate a score for each tweet based on the assigned values. Based on the score, the tweets will be categorized as strong positive, positive, neutral, negative, or strong negative.
