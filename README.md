# Sentiment Analysis
How to perform sentiment analysis on tweets' replies 

# Usage 
We used NLTK package to determine if a tweet has strong positive, positive, neutral, negative or strong neutral sentiment. First, the group had a list for positive words and a list of negative words. Then, the group assigned values to the positive, neutral and negative words. NLTK would detect how many positive and negative words there were in each tweet and calculate a score for each tweet based on the assigned values. Based on the score, the tweets will be categorized as strong positive, positive, neutral, negative, or strong negative.
